# scale-theory V1.0
Personal project I made because there were no good apps that let you 
Easily and freely access all tuning and scales. 

Select a key, a scale, and an instrument/tuning

Click on a root note to highlight all notes in the scale within 5 frets

Scales are separated by a category

20+ scales and 4 instruments with 10+ tunings.


Written in pure JS.
